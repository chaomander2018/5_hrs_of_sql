This repo is about the SQL course I developed in 2018.

## What is it?
This repo contains the course materials, exercises and answers keys I developed. This is an accelerated course for people who want to learn how to use SQL. The course is based on SQLite and PostgreSQL.

I have taught students individually based on their level of understanding regarding tabular data. 

## Why 5 hours?
According to Josh Kaufman's TED talk [The first 20 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY), you can learn anything within 20 hours. But I found relating what people know about data (Excel, Access) help them understanding SQL way faster. I found most of the online SQL courses are more than 5 hours, hence I want to challenge to teach people SQL in five hours. 

## Who is this for?
This course is designed for professionals who have some literacy with tabular data. 

## Usage
This repo contains the course materials, exercises and answers keys I developed for my 5 hours of SQL course.
